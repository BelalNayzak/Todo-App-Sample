- **Reactive UI:** Utilizes GetX for state management, dependency injection, and route management, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Error Handling:** Custom error handling ensures smooth and user-friendly interactions.
- **Unit Tested:** Core functionalities are thoroughly tested, ensuring the reliability and robustness of the app.
